# Contributing to `cn`

## Reporting bugs
Bugs can be reported on both [GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/arijit79/cn/issues/) as well as the mirror
[GitHub](https://github.com/arijit79/cn/issues). Although the issues
are handled separately on both platforms.

* Bugs report should be short and descriptive
* You should describe what you have tried to do
* If you get any output, please do provide it
* Version number can always prove helpful

## Writing Code
Code can be submitted both on GitHub Pull Requests or GitLab Merge 
Requests.
* Fork the repository
* Clone it into your local machine
* Make whatever changes you like
* Commit and push your changes
* Create your Pull/Merge Request using the GitHub/GitLab UI
* If your PR?MR consists of multiple commits, you should squash the 
commits
* Once we agree to your PR/MR, it will be merged into the upstream
